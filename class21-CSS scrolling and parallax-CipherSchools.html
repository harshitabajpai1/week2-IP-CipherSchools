        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of 
        a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including
         XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
         CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
    </p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
         including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
          provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
           multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
            complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
         .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file       </p>
